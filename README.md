# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of the Challenge Assingment was to add a weather description to the weather data I already retrieved in the module. Then, users are able to filter through the data based on their weather preferences which are used to identify potential travel destinations. I chose four cities where I created a travel itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API, I also created a travel route between the four cities and displayed a marker layer map.
